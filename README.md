Flower Prediction Web Application Using Flask
This project is a simple and efficient web application for predicting the species of a flower based on input features like petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. The app is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and utilizes a machine learning model trained on the popular Iris dataset.

Key Features:
Flask Framework: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.
Machine Learning Model: A pre-trained model that classifies flowers into species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on their physical features.
Interactive UI: Users can input flower measurements and get a real-time prediction of the flower species.
Predictive Accuracy: The model is trained using scikit-learn and offers high accuracy on the Iris dataset.
Technologies Used:
Flask: For creating the web application.
scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning model.
Pandas & NumPy: For handling and processing the data.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For frontend development and user interaction.
How to Run:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-prediction-flask.git
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask app:
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to start making predictions.
This project demonstrates the combination of machine learning and web development, and can be extended for various applications such as flower recognition in real-world environments.ace.
