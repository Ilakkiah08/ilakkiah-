Flower Prediction Using Flask

The flower prediction system is a machine learning application built using Flask, a web framework for Python. The objective of the system is to predict the type of flower based on user-provided input such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, typically for species like Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.

Key Components:
Machine Learning Model: The core of the flower prediction system is a trained machine learning model. This can be a classification model, such as a decision tree, random forest, or support vector machine (SVM), that predicts the type of flower based on the four features (sepal and petal dimensions). A commonly used dataset for this task is the Iris dataset, which includes labeled data for three species of Iris flowers.

Flask Web Framework: Flask is used to create a lightweight web application that allows users to interact with the prediction model. The user can input the flower dimensions into a form, and the Flask app will process the input, pass it to the trained model, and return the predicted flower species.

Steps to Implement:

Model Training: First, a machine learning model is trained using the Iris dataset (or another relevant dataset) in a Python environment with libraries like scikit-learn.
Save the Model: After training, the model is saved using tools like joblib or pickle to persist it and make it available for use in the Flask app.
Flask App Development: A Flask app is created with HTML forms to allow the user to enter the flower's sepal and petal dimensions. When the form is submitted, the Flask server takes the input, loads the saved model, and makes a prediction.
Prediction Result: The result (predicted flower species) is displayed back to the user on the web page.
Example Workflow:

A user visits the web page and inputs values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The Flask backend receives the input, processes it, and uses the pre-trained machine learning model to make a prediction.
The predicted flower species is returned and shown to the user, e.g., "Iris setosa," along with the confidence level of the prediction.
Technologies Involved:

Flask: For web development and routing.
scikit-learn: For model training and prediction.
HTML/CSS: To design the front-end form.
Joblib/ Pickle: To save and load the trained model.
This project helps in deploying machine learning models as real-time applications, where users can make predictions based on real-world input in an easy-to-use web interface.
